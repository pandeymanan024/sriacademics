        If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use our
        services. We may modify the Terms at any time, and your continued use
        after changes implies your acceptance. We recommend reviewing these
        Terms periodically. You must be at least 18 years old or have
        parental/legal guardian consent to register. Parents or guardians are
        responsible for managing accounts of minors. You agree to provide
        accurate registration information and keep it up to date. You are
        responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
        credentials and for all activity under your account. Sri Academics
        grants you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to access
        and use our platform solely for your personal and educational use. You
        may not reproduce, distribute, modify, transmit, reuse, repost, or use
        content from our platform for public or commercial purposes without
        prior permission. All intellectual property rights, including content,
        graphics, and software, belong to Sri Academics or its licensors. You
        agree not to use our platform for any unlawful purpose or in any way
        that could harm, impair, or interfere with our services. Prohibited
        activities include impersonation, spamming, using bots or scripts,
        collecting other users’ data, infringing on others’ rights, or using the
        platform to circumvent payment obligations or solicit business without
        permission. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access and
        delete your account, content, or any material you post if you violate
        these Terms or the rights of others, or for any other reason, at our
        sole discretion. Following such termination, you may lose access to your
        account and data. All fees are payable as per the plans selected on our
        platform. Refunds, if offered, will be handled in accordance with our
        Refund Policy. Sri Academics reserves the right to change its pricing or
        offers, and any updates will be communicated on the website or via
        email. We may include links to third-party websites or services. These
        links are provided for convenience and do not imply endorsement. We are
        not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or terms of any
        linked websites. Your use of the platform is at your own risk. To the
        extent permitted by law, Sri Academics and its affiliates exclude all
        warranties, whether express or implied, including fitness for a
        particular purpose, title, or non‑infringement. We do not guarantee
        uninterrupted, error-free, or secure access. Information on the platform
        may be outdated or incorrect, and we are not liable for any inaccuracies
        or content you rely upon. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
        law, Sri Academics will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special,
        punitive, or consequential damages, including loss of profits, data,
        reputation, or goodwill, arising from your use or inability to use the
        services, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. In no
        event shall our total liability exceed the amount you paid to us in the
        six months preceding the claim. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
        harmless Sri Academics, its officers, directors, employees, agents, and
        affiliates from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or
        expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from your
        violation of these Terms or any applicable law, or your use of the
        platform. Any dispute arising from these Terms shall be governed by the
        laws of India, excluding conflict-of-law rules. The courts of Bhopal,
        Madhya Pradesh, shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any disputes.
        Where permitted, disputes may be referred to arbitration under the
        Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, with proceedings conducted in
        English in Bhopal. If any provision of these Terms is found to be
        invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be deemed severable and
        the remaining provisions shall remain in full force. Failure by
        Sri Academics to enforce any right or provision shall not constitute a
        waiver. Headings are for convenience only and do not affect
        interpretation. For any questions or requests concerning these Terms,
        refunds, or account termination, please contact us
